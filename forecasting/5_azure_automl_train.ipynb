    "# Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) on Azure for Retail Sales Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to apply [AutoML in Azure Machine Learning services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml) to train and tune machine learning models for forecasting product sales in retail. We will use the Orange Juice dataset to illustrate the steps of utilizing AutoML as well as how to combine an AutoML model with a custom model for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoML is a process of automating the tasks of machine learning model development. It helps data scientists and other practitioners build machine learning models with high scalability and quality in less amount of time. AutoML in Azure Machine Learning allows you to train and tune a model using a target metric that you specify. This service iterates through machine learning algorithms and feature selection approaches, producing a score that measures the quality of each machine learning pipeline. The best model will then be selected based on the scores. For more technical details about Azure AutoML, please check [this paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7595-probabilistic-matrix-factorization-for-automated-machine-learning.pdf)."

    "## Set up Azure Machine Learning Workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "An Azure ML workspace is an Azure resource that organizes and coordinates the actions of many other Azure resources to assist in executing and sharing machine learning workflows. In particular, an Azure ML workspace coordinates storage, databases, and compute resources providing added functionality for machine learning experimentation, deployment, inference, and the monitoring of deployed models. To create an Azure ML workspace, first you need access to an Azure subscription. An Azure subscription allows you to manage storage, compute, and other assets in the Azure cloud. You can [create a new subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) or access existing subscription information from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Given that you have access to your Azure subscription, you can further create an Azure ML workspace by following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-workspace). You can also do so [using Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-workspace-cli) or the `Workspace.create()` method in Azure SDK.\n",
